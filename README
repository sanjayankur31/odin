# Odin is a mini project that some of my class mates and me are doing 
# as a part of our academic requirements. 
#
# We are going to try and implement the MinMax and Alpha Beta Pruning techniques
# to create two AI opponents to play against each other
#
# We intend to collect data on the two opponents, such as time taken per move, to 
# compare the two techniques.
# 
# For more info, check synopsis.pdf in the root repository directory.

The needed dependencies are:

- ncurses
- glib
- colour support on terminal

That's all you need to build and play it!
